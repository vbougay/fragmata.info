# Fragmata.info: Cyprus Reservoir Visualizer

A comprehensive dashboard for monitoring and visualizing water reservoir data across all 21 major reservoirs in Cyprus. Built with Next.js App Router for server-side rendering and SEO. Track storage levels, inflow trends, drain forecasts, and historical changes through 52 data snapshots spanning March 2025 to March 2026.

## Data Source

All data is sourced from the [Cyprus Water Development Department](https://www.moa.gov.cy/moa/wdd/Wdd.nsf/page18_en/page18_en?opendocument) of the Ministry of Agriculture. The application includes 52 data snapshots covering March 2025 through March 2026, with information on all 21 reservoirs including capacity, current storage, inflow rates, and historical comparisons.

## Forecasting Approach

The dashboard uses a cycle-aware forecasting engine built on 38 years of historical reservoir storage data (1988–2025). Rather than simple linear extrapolation, it models the multi-year drought-wet cycles that characterize Cyprus's climate.

**Storage Forecast** — Historical water years are classified into dry, moderate, and wet categories based on annual net storage change. The engine identifies the current position in the drought-wet cycle (declining, trough, recovering, or peak) and finds analog years with similar storage levels and trends. Three forward scenarios are simulated over 10 years:

- **Drought**: Assumes dry-year water balance every year (worst case)
- **Expected**: Models the typical cycle — remaining decline followed by recovery then moderation
- **Recovery**: Assumes wet conditions for 2 years then moderate (best case)

Forecasts can be viewed for the entire system, individual regions (Southern Conveyor, Paphos, Chrysochou, Nicosia), or major dams (Kouris, Asprokremmos, Evretou, Kannaviou). Water restriction dates show when storage is projected to drop below a 7% capacity threshold — the point where restrictions typically begin, well before actual depletion.

**Inflow Prediction** — The Monthly Inflow chart predicts remaining months of the current water year using the same cycle classification. Instead of averaging all historical years equally, it averages only the years matching the expected scenario's year type (dry/moderate/wet), producing predictions consistent with the storage forecast.

## API

A public REST API is available at `https://fragmata.info/api/v1/` — no authentication required. It provides endpoints for reservoir summary, individual reservoirs, regional totals, inflow data, and historical storage levels. See [API.md](API.md) for full documentation and Home Assistant integration examples.
