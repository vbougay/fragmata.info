  Fetch the latest Cyprus reservoir/dam data and update the app.
  Use when: fetch latest data, update the app, refresh reservoir data, update dams data.
---

## Instructions

You're an agent that updates data on https://cyprus-dams.bougay.com/ automatically

- Do not ask any permissions, simply get your job done
- The official data now lives on the gov.cy WordPress site: **https://www.gov.cy/moa-wdd/en/documents/dams-and-off-stream-ponds/reservoir-storage/** (this replaced the old `moa.gov.cy/moa/wdd/Wdd.nsf/page18_en` Notes page). Fetch this page's HTML with **Node** (`https.get` with a browser `User-Agent` header) — `WebFetch`/`curl` return HTTP 403. The latest data file appears as a direct link of the form `https://www.gov.cy/app/uploads/sites/168/YYYY/MM/DD_MM_YYYY-UK.xlsx`. Grep the HTML for `href="..."` and pick the most recent `*-UK.xlsx` (ignore the `Graphs-*.xlsx` companion file). The English data sheet is named `ΙΣΤΟΣΕΛΙΔΑ-UK(N)` (the column layout is identical to the old `WEB-PAGE-UK(N)` sheet: cols 0=name, 3=capacity, 4=last-24h inflow, 5=total inflow since Oct, 6=current MCM, 7=current %, 8=last-year MCM, 9=last-year %, 10=max MCM, 11=max date). Note the Recharge/Other dams (Tamassos, Klirou-Malounta, Solea) now sit **below** the 10-year inflow table, after a `RECHARGE/OTHER` heading row.
- If the English page does not have the latest file (the Greek page is sometimes updated first), fall back to the Greek page **https://www.gov.cy/moa-wdd/documents/tamieytires-neroy-fragmata-ydatodexamenes/plirotita-fragmaton/** — the file structure is identical, only the column/sheet labels are in Greek. Still use English dam names in the new data module (the standard naming used everywhere in the app). The Greek file name uses `GR.xlsx` instead of `UK.xlsx`, and the data sheet is named `ΙΣΤΟΣΕΛΙΔΑ-GR(N)`.
- **Fresh bulletin, stale data link**: sometimes the Greek page shows a newer bulletin date — the `Graphs-DD_MM_YYYY.xlsx` companion gets refreshed to the new date (e.g. `Graphs-20_07_2026.xlsx` alongside a stale `16_07_2026-GR.xlsx`) — while the data XLSX for that date is not linked yet. It is usually **already uploaded at a predictable URL** — probe directly (HTTP HEAD/GET) before concluding there's no new data:
  - `https://www.gov.cy/app/uploads/sites/168/YYYY/MM/DD-MONTHNAME-YYYY-UK.xlsx` (e.g. `.../2026/02/20-JULY-2026-UK.xlsx`; full uppercase English month name; the `/YYYY/MM/` path segment is the upload folder — reuse the one from the currently linked files, it does not track the report month)
  - Same name under `https://www.gov.cy/media/sites/168/YYYY/MM/` and the `-GR.xlsx` variants
- Download the latest XLSX data and save it to @data folder (filename format `DD-MMM-YYYYUK.xlsx`, e.g. `19-JUN-2026UK.xlsx`). Use Node to download the XLSX file (not Curl) and parse it. DON'T continue until you downloaded the latest data file
- Create a new datafile in the app based on the downloaded data.
- Archive the weekly water bulletin workbook (see **Weekly water bulletin archive** below) — one command, run on every update.
- Make sure that the app builds with the latest changes, commit them to Git and push to the origin
- After push, send the latest community post to Telegram (see **Telegram delivery** below)
- Exit once done

## Cloud runs (the "Fragmata data update" routine)

The update also runs unattended in the cloud: a Vercel cron job checks the gov.cy pages
every 10 minutes and fires this routine when a newer bulletin appears (see
`CLOUD-AUTOMATION.md`).
A cloud session is a **fresh checkout**, so anything gitignored is simply absent —
`community/*` (except the tracked `community/TELEGRAM.md`), `logs/`, `.env.local`, and all
of `scripts/` except `scripts/og/`. When those files are missing, you are in a cloud run:
apply these overrides.

- **Install first**: `corepack enable && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. Retry once on registry failure.
- **The fire payload**: the `<routine-fire-payload>` block carries `detected_bulletin_date`
  and the `deployed_dataset` the cron compared against. Treat the date as a hint that saves
  you a lookup — still confirm it against the pages, and if the data XLSX for it isn't
  linked yet, probe the predictable URLs (see the stale-link note above).
- **`community/TELEGRAM.md` is present and git-tracked** — read it the same way a local run
  would, for both the `daysSinceLatest`/schedule check and the exact Telegram post shape (see
  the template in **Platform formatting** below). `community/WHATSAPP.md` and any other
  sibling file are still gitignored and absent — cloud runs only post to Telegram, not
  WhatsApp; leave that platform's post to a local run.
- **Narrative context** — optional supplement for the *website* `getSummaryChanges` story arc
  (markdown, links, different structure from the Telegram file):
  ```bash
  curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $INTERNAL_API_SECRET" \
    "https://fragmata.info/api/internal/narrative?limit=6"
  ```
  Returns the recent datasets' `getSummaryChanges` narratives in all three languages, newest
  first, plus `daysSinceLatest`. Since the recent `data-*.ts` modules are also tracked and
  present in the checkout, reading them directly works just as well — use whichever is
  convenient.
- **Telegram** replaces `tsx scripts/post-telegram.ts`:
  ```bash
  curl -s -X POST "https://fragmata.info/api/internal/telegram" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $INTERNAL_API_SECRET" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d @post.json   # {"text": "<the Telegram post body>"}   add "dryRun": true to preview
  ```
  Write the body to a temp JSON file rather than inlining it, to avoid shell-quoting
  problems. Expect `{"ok":true,"messageId":…,"chatId":…}`; a 422 means the post exceeds
  Telegram's 4096-char limit — shorten it and retry. Retry once on a network failure.
- **Attach the card by uploading it, not by URL.** The post should carry the dashboard OG card
  as its image (see **Image attachment** below), but the cloud flow sends Telegram *before* the
  commit is pushed, so the card served by the site is still the previous dataset's. Render this
  run's card locally and upload it with the request instead — `scripts/og/` is tracked, so it's
  in the checkout:
  ```bash
  pnpm og      # regenerates public/og/*.png from the new default dataset
  curl -s -X POST "https://fragmata.info/api/internal/telegram" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $INTERNAL_API_SECRET" \
    -F "text=<$post.txt" \
    -F "photo=@public/og/dashboard.en.png;type=image/png"
  ```
  Run `pnpm og` **after** `dataManager.ts` points at the new dataset, or you'll upload the old
  card. Pass the body via `-F "text=<file"` rather than inline, to avoid shell-quoting problems;
  add `-F "dryRun=true"` to preview (the response echoes `photo: "upload:… (N bytes)"` so you can
  confirm the file arrived). Uploads must be PNG or JPEG and under 4MB — a card is ~120KB.
  Add `-F "noPhoto=true"` for a text-only post if the card can't be rendered; a post with no
  image beats a post whose image contradicts it.
  The JSON body form (above) attaches the *deployed* card by URL — correct for local runs that
  post after the deploy, wrong here.
- **Git flow: one commit, pushed straight to `main`, after Telegram is sent.** Cloud runs
  skip branches entirely — no local `work` branch, no run branch ever pushed to origin.
  Every branch pushed to this repo gets its own Vercel preview deploy, so even a
  pushed-then-deleted run branch burns a deploy for nothing; `main` is the only ref this
  routine ever pushes, and it pushes it exactly once. The order matters — Telegram goes out
  *before* you commit, because the `message_id` it returns has to land in the same commit as
  the dataset:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin main
  git checkout -B main origin/main        # start from the current tip of main
  # ...edit data-DD-MMM-YYYY.ts, dataManager.ts, historicalStorageData.ts...
  # ...send the Telegram post via the relay (see above), capture message_id...
  # ...append the Sent: annotation + post to community/TELEGRAM.md (see After a successful send)...
  git add -A
  git commit -m "..."                     # exactly one commit for the whole run
  git push origin main
  ```
  If `git push` is rejected because `main` moved during the run, `git fetch origin main &&
  git rebase origin/main` (still one commit) and retry — never force-push `main`. Never write
  a future-dated / not-yet-sent draft into `community/TELEGRAM.md` (it's a public repo);
  drafts belong in the still-gitignored `community/DRAFTS.md` until they've actually gone out.
- **If the bulletin turns out to be no newer than the deployed dataset**: make no commits,
  send nothing to Telegram, and say so — there's nothing to push. The one exception: still
  run the water bulletin archiver, and if it saved a new edition, commit and push just
  `data/water-bulletin/` (no Telegram post).

## Weekly water bulletin archive

Since June 2026 the WDD also posts a weekly workbook, `ΔΕΛΤΙΟ_ΝΕΡΟΥ_DASHBOARD_2026-14-ΣΕΠ-26.xlsx`
and the like, on the Greek page: weekly output per desalination unit and treatment plant,
plus inflow and measured releases for the largest dams. The WDD removes the old edition
when it posts a new one and nothing else keeps them, so every run of this skill archives
whatever is listed:

```bash
node .claude/skills/fetch-and-update/archive-water-bulletin.mjs
```

- The script is tracked and has no dependencies, so it works in local and cloud runs alike.
  It reads the site's upload index, downloads each edition it has not seen (by media id)
  into `data/water-bulletin/`, and logs it in `data/water-bulletin/index.tsv`. Running it
  again is a no-op. `--dry-run` lists without saving.
- Commit whatever it adds together with the dataset (the cloud flow's `git add -A` already
  picks it up). Most runs add nothing: editions are weekly at best and weeks get skipped.
- **When it adds an edition, regenerate the app's weekly data** (the /desalination page,
  the dashboard's "tap water from desalination" line and the article charts read it):

  ```bash
  npx tsx .claude/skills/fetch-and-update/water-bulletin-to-ts.ts
  ```

  This rewrites `src/utils/desalinationWeekly.ts` from every workbook in the archive; commit
  it with the dataset. If the WDD changes the workbook layout, the script prints fewer
  "editions with plant output" than before: check the new file rather than shipping a gap.
  Do not mention the weekly bulletin in the summary or community posts.
- **Never let it block the update.** If it exits non-zero (gov.cy down, index changed),
  retry once, note the failure in your final message, and carry on with the dam data.

## Best Practices to Avoid Issues

**Inline Node.js in Bash:**

- Use single quotes around the entire `-e` script to prevent bash variable substitution issues
- Reference objects/arrays with proper syntax: `jsonData[i][j]` works, but avoid template expressions
- Test extraction logic with simple console.logs before building complex transformations
- **Make the script exit cleanly.** Node keeps running until the event loop drains, and an idle keep-alive socket to gov.cy can hold it open long past the point where all output has printed — the process then gets reaped by the Bash timeout and mislabeled as "hung." Two guards, use both:
  - Send `"Connection": "close"` in the request headers so sockets don't linger.
  - End the top-level async IIFE with `.then(() => process.exit(0), e => { console.error(e); process.exit(1); })` so the process terminates the moment its work is done. (All `console.log`s have already run by then, so nothing is lost.)

**File Creation:**

- Never create temporary script files (like parse-xlsx.js) - always use inline bash commands
- Keep all ad-hoc scripts as one-liners or multi-line inline bash, not separate files

 **Data Module Creation:**

- Follow existing data-*.ts patterns exactly
- Ensure all 21 reservoirs are included with correct regional assignments
- Compare to the latest previous dataset available
- Update dataManager.ts imports AND availableDataSets array AND default dataset ID

**Historical Storage Data (`historicalStorageData.ts`):**

The historical heatmap chart uses `src/utils/historicalStorageData.ts` — it must be updated alongside each new data module or the chart will stop at the previous date.

- Add a new entry to the `historicalStorageData` array with the current storage amounts from the new data module
- Use the format: `{ date: "YYYY-MM-DD", kouris: X, kalavasos: X, ... , totalSCP: X, totalAll: X }`
- `totalSCP` = sum of Southern Conveyor reservoirs (kouris, kalavasos, lefkara, dipotamos, germasoyeia, arminou, polemidia, achna)
- `totalAll` = sum of all 21 reservoirs
- The storage values come from each reservoir's `storage.current.amount` in the new data module

**Narrative coherence** — the `getSummaryChanges` text, articles, and community posts are all part of one evolving story. Before writing any of them:
- Read the recent entries in `community/TELEGRAM.md` (tracked, present in every run including cloud) and the latest `getSummaryChanges` to understand the current narrative arc
- Each new update should advance the story — reference what changed since the last post, build on previous milestones, and avoid restating old news as if it's new
- Let the data drive the narrative: when the situation shifts (e.g. a drought easing, a new region recovering, a plateau forming), the tone and focus should shift with it
- Keep all three outputs consistent — they can differ in length and format but should not contradict each other or tell different stories
- Articles with future dates are pre-scheduled drafts — ignore them when determining the current narrative state. Community posts don't have this problem: `community/TELEGRAM.md` only ever holds posts that have actually been sent (see **Community Post** below on where drafts belong instead)

**Summary / Recent Changes (`getSummaryChanges`):**

- For comparison use the date 7-10 days away
- Keep it concise — highlight only notable or important changes, not every region or reservoir
- Lead with overall storage change (percentage and MCM)
- Mention notable individual reservoir movements (large swings, transfers, overflows) — skip small incremental changes
- **Link dam names to their detail pages**: every dam name mentioned in the text (both bold and non-bold, including inline references like transfers) should be a markdown link to its detail page:
  - English: `[Kouris](/dam/kouris/)`, `[Arminou](/dam/arminou/)→[Kouris](/dam/kouris/)`
  - Greek: `[Κούρης](/el/dam/kouris/)`, `[Αρμίνου](/el/dam/arminou/)→[Κούρης](/el/dam/kouris/)`
  - Russian: `[Курис](/ru/dam/kouris/)`, `[Арминоу](/ru/dam/arminou/)→[Курис](/ru/dam/kouris/)`
  - Use the English slug from `DAM_SLUG_MAP` in `src/utils/slugs.ts` (e.g., `agia-marina`, `klirou-malounta`)
  - The locale prefix is: none for `en`, `/el` for Greek, `/ru` for Russian
- Search the web for Cyprus water/reservoir/drought news from the past week and incorporate relevant context (government plans, drought status, weather events)
- Add up to 3 media article links at the end under an "In the media" / "Στα μέσα" section
- Write both English, Russian and Greek versions with the same structure
- Tone: informative and factual, not verbose

**Per-Dam Summaries (`getDamSummary`):**

Each data module should export a `getDamSummary(damName, language)` function that returns a short 1-2 sentence summary for each of the 21 dams. These are displayed as subtitles on dam pages and used as SEO meta descriptions.

- Write concise, single-line summaries (110–155 characters for SEO — not shorter, or Google will substitute its own snippet; not longer, or it will be truncated)
- Include: current fill %, storage in MCM, year-over-year comparison
- Highlight notable conditions: at full capacity, critically low, transfers, dramatic recovery, new annual max
- Support all 3 languages (`'en' | 'el' | 'ru'`)
- Return `string | null` — return `null` if dam name not found
- Follow the pattern in `data-20-MAR-2026.ts` as reference
- The function is exposed via `dataManager.ts` (`getDamSummary` wrapper) — no changes needed there, it auto-detects the function

**Telegram delivery:**

(Local runs. In a cloud run the script isn't in the checkout — POST to the relay endpoint
in **Cloud runs** above instead.)

After the git push, send the Telegram version of the community post you just wrote by piping it into the CLI:

```bash
tsx scripts/post-telegram.ts <<'EOF'
<paste the exact text that belongs inside the ### Telegram code fence in community/TELEGRAM.md>
EOF
```

(`tsx` is expected to be on the user's PATH — installed globally via `pnpm add -g tsx`.)

- The script reads the message from stdin and POSTs it via the Telegram Bot API — it does not parse `TELEGRAM.md` itself; you pass the text
- It auto-loads `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` from `.env.local` at the repo root (gitignored)
- Currently posts to the user's DM with the bot; user forwards to the channel manually. To switch to direct channel posting later, either change `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` to the channel's `@handle` or pass `--chat-id @handle` (bot must be an admin there)
- Use `--dry-run` to print the length, the photo URL, and a preview without sending
- The script prints the returned `message_id` and `chat_id` on stdout — capture them

**Image attachment** — every post goes out as a photo with the text as its caption, so
forwarding the single message carries the whole package:

- The image is the dashboard OG card. A local run attaches it by URL —
  `https://fragmata.info/og/dashboard.en.png?v=<report date>`, built by the script itself from
  the current default dataset, so you don't pass it. The `?v=` is the cache-buster that makes
  Telegram (and the CDN) fetch *this* update's card rather than yesterday's.
- **A URL-attached card only works after the push to `main` has deployed.** The card is a
  static file regenerated by `pnpm og` during the build; posting before the deploy attaches the
  previous dataset's numbers. Cloud runs post before the push, so they upload a locally
  rendered card instead — see **Cloud runs** above.
- Posts up to 1024 chars (Telegram's caption cap) go as one photo+caption message — that covers
  nearly every post. A longer one degrades gracefully: card + title line first, then the full
  text as a second message. Record the first message's `message_id` in `community/TELEGRAM.md`
  as usual.
- Overrides, rarely needed: `--photo <url>` for a different card (e.g. a dam card when the post
  is about one dam), `--no-photo` for text-only.

**After a successful send**, record the identifiers inside `community/TELEGRAM.md` so a later edit or delete can target the right message:

- Add a visible one-line annotation directly under the `### Telegram` heading of the post you just sent (above the opening ``` fence), in this exact format:
  ```
  ### Telegram
  Sent: message_id=<id>, chat_id=<chat_id>, at=<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ>
  ```
  `` ``` ``
  ...message text...
  `` ``` ``
- Use the exact `message_id` and `chat_id` printed by the script (or by the relay's JSON
  response in a cloud run), and the current UTC timestamp for `at=`
- `community/TELEGRAM.md` is git-tracked — commit this edit (local runs: as part of the normal
  commit; cloud runs: alongside the dataset commit, before pushing to `main`)
- If the send fails, skip this step — nothing to record

**News Ticker Refresh:**

The dashboard has a scrolling news ticker showing recent water crisis articles. Keep it current on each data update:

- Search the web for recent Cyprus water/reservoir/drought articles in all three languages (EN, EL, RU)
- Update `src/utils/newsArticles.ts` — add new articles following the existing `{ title, url, lang, source }` format
- Update `NEWS.md` to keep it in sync (grouped by language: English, Russian, Greek)
- Keep the list reasonable — cap at ~10 articles per language, removing older or less relevant ones
- Prefer articles from established Cyprus outlets (Cyprus Mail, Politis, AlphaNews, Европа Кипр, Вестник Кипра, etc.)

**Community Post (`community/TELEGRAM.md` + `community/WHATSAPP.md`):**

After each data update, append a new community post entry to both `community/TELEGRAM.md` and `community/WHATSAPP.md`. Each entry carries the same `## <date>` heading and summary line in both files, followed by that platform's code block (`### Telegram` in TELEGRAM.md, `### WhatsApp` in WHATSAPP.md).

`community/TELEGRAM.md` is git-tracked (this is a **public** repo) — only ever append a post
*after* it has been sent; never write a future-dated or not-yet-sent draft into it. Drafts go
in the still-gitignored `community/DRAFTS.md` and move over once sent. `community/WHATSAPP.md`
(and any other sibling file) stays gitignored/local-only, no such restriction there.

- **Schedule**: Major updates on Mon/Wed/Fri, minor updates on Tue/Thu. If more than 1 day has passed since the last data update, always do a major update regardless of day.
- **Determining the last update**: Check the last `## <date>` heading in `community/TELEGRAM.md` to find when the previous post was made — the file is tracked and present in every run, local or cloud. (`daysSinceLatest` from the narrative endpoint works too, if you're already fetching it for the website narrative.)
- **Drafts vs. sent posts**: `community/TELEGRAM.md` is a public, git-tracked file — only append an entry *after* the post has actually been sent (i.e. you have a real `message_id`). Anything written ahead of time (a scheduled article announcement, a pre-planned post) belongs in `community/DRAFTS.md` instead, which stays gitignored. Move it into `TELEGRAM.md` once it's actually gone out.

**Minor data updates** (📊):
- Headline: total storage % and MCM, delta from previous update (e.g. "up from 26.9% yesterday")
- 24-hour inflow: total across all dams, plus the top 2-3 individual dam inflows
- Bullet points: only notable changes since previous update — new season highs, milestones (crossing round numbers like 30%), large pp swings (>1pp), transfers, unchanged laggards
- Show pp deltas in parentheses (e.g. "+1.3pp") for reservoirs that moved significantly
- End with gap vs last year and dashboard link
- Keep concise — 6-8 bullet points max

**Major updates** (📰):
- Used when publishing an article or after a gap of >1 day
- Narrative summary paragraph describing what happened
- Detailed bullet points with context (year-over-year comparisons, multi-day trends)
- Include article link if one was published, plus dashboard link
- Can reference previous articles/predictions when relevant

**Headline total calculation**: Exclude Recharge/Other dams (Tamassos, Klirou-Malounta, Solea) from the headline storage % and MCM — this matches the dashboard. Individual Recharge dams can still appear in bullet points.

**Platform formatting** — one code block per file:

Telegram (`### Telegram`):
- Plain text, no markdown formatting (asterisks show literally when pasted)
- Use `•` for bullets
- Bold is applied manually after pasting (select + Cmd+B)
- 📊 or 📰 emoji prefix on the first line
- End with `🔗 https://fragmata.info`
- **Follow this exact shape** — established across 80+ prior posts (see `community/TELEGRAM.md`
  history; in a cloud run that file is absent, so this template IS the spec, don't improvise):
  ```
  [emoji] Cyprus Dams — [Month Day]

  [Day-of-week] bulletin: total storage [X]% ([Y] MCM) — [down/up] [Z] MCM from [prior day-name
  or date], [pace commentary, e.g. "the same slow drawdown pace continuing"]. [Optional 1-sentence
  standout story — often a running thread like Arminou's rise/plateau]. Gap over last year:
  +[N]pp. Season inflow: [N] MCM (July so far: [N] MCM). Arminou→Kouris transfer unchanged at
  20.44 MCM.

  • [Dam] X% (±N.Npp) — [short context]
  • [Dam] X% (±N.Npp) — [short context]
  • [Dam] X% (±N.Npp) — [short context]
  • Kalopanagiotis 100% — still the only dam overflowing
  • Achna 1.9% — unchanged, zero inflow all season

  Gap vs last year: +[N]pp.

  🔗 https://fragmata.info
  ```
  - The title line is mandatory: `[emoji] Cyprus Dams — [Month Day]` (no year, no "Update" suffix
    in recent posts), blank line, then the paragraph.
  - The paragraph opens with the day of week ("Friday bulletin:", "Monday bulletin, covering the
    weekend:") — use the day name for gaps up to ~3 days; switch to an explicit date ("down from
    40.9% on July 16") for longer gaps.
  - `Kalopanagiotis 100%` and `Achna 1.9%` are recurring anchor bullets — include them nearly
    every post since they're part of the running narrative, not just "notable movements."
  - `Gap vs last year: +N pp.` appears **twice** — once inline in the paragraph, once again as
    its own line right before the closing link. Keep both; it's the established convention, not
    a duplication bug.
  - Track any multi-post storyline (e.g. "Arminou is the only riser") and give it a line even
    when the move is small (+0.1pp) — the continuity is the point.

WhatsApp (`### WhatsApp`):
- Wrap key numbers and headings in `*asterisks*` for native bold rendering
- Use `•` for bullets
- 📊 or 📰 emoji prefix on the first line
- End with `🔗 https://fragmata.info`

**What to highlight** — let the data decide, don't repeat a fixed list of dams:
- Compare today's data vs previous update: pick the largest pp and MCM movers
- Milestones: crossing round-number thresholds (e.g. 30%, 50%, 100%), first-time events (exceeding last year, overflowing)
- Extremes: dams at 100% or near 0%, dramatic year-over-year ratios
- Active transfers between dams (if `waterTransferred` changed)
- Aim for variety across posts — rotate which dams get mentioned rather than always leading with the same ones
- Use `×` (multiplication sign) not `x` for multipliers
